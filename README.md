# generic-child-theme
 
Just an (almost) generic child theme. It works with many WordPress themes (definitely with all current standard themes, as well as with teh best themes of all: Blankslate). It is based on the standard child theme approach as documented at https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/

Should you run into problems and it doesn't work, the only reason for that could lie in the enqueueing of the stylesheet. You may find an answer at the same above linked page in the WP developer manual.

As a bonus this child theme contains a minimal version of the new fance theme.json file. And it works too â€¦

Enjoy!
